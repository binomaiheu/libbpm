Here's a list of TODO items...

--> still a bit unclear on how to generate the initial beam
    conditions...

--> maybe at a later point have the reserved memory in routines
    like fit_waveform be static so we don't have to reserve + free 
    it call after call, might speed things up...

---> in fit_waveform.c:
  - Probably need to put in some box constraints for better behaviour at a certain point, 
    can use the routine nr_lmder_bc for this. 
  - Maybe program in something to replace the matrix inversion based upon the LU algorithm
    in nr_levmar.c. The original version had some LAPACK functionality, but as we
    wanted this standalone, i've cut it out. 
  - Best way to use it probably to take the parameters from previous fit of last pulse and have
    them as initials for the current fit.

--> in fit_fft.c
  - properly check fitting algorithm, works... but question is how well...


--> in process_waveform.c
  - if the waveform is saturated, we now set the tSample to the time of the last
    unsaturated sample, still need to shift this in order to have a decent sampling
    window...
