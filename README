libbpm
This is the README file

The main library is in fact a collection of little sublibraries which
represent different components of the processing/simulation chain :

These are : 
bpmanalysis/     : resolution calculation etc..
bpmcalibration/  : calibration routines  
bpminterface/    : the interface structures between different 
                   components, this piece will implement
                   bpmconf_t, beamconf_t etc...
bpmmessages/     : some messaging routines used thoughout the lib
bpmnr/           : numerical recipies
bpmorbit/        : orbit generation routines, get positions in the bpm
bpmprocess/      : signal processing, fitting, ddc, ...
bpmrf/           : RF simulation routines
bpmsimulation/   : waveform simulation routines


Also there will be some wrappers for the library for other people to
use
like labview, matlab and root, these will reside in 

labview/         
matlab/
root-wrapper/

One special directory "bpm/" is used to collect all the header files
from all the sublibraries during compilation. Each individual
sublibrary comes with its own header file and there are all collected
so we can clearly have in each source e.g. 
#include <bpm/bpm_interface.h>

The bootstrapping of the CVS version is done using "autogen.sh",
simply executing this script should be enough to create the configure
script. 

The library comes with a script "libbpm-config", which analogous to
"root-config" returns the installation path and library paths for use
in Makefiles that depend upon libbpm, so e.g. :

[niblap] ~/ilc/devel/cvs/especSoft/libbpm $ libbpm-config --libs

prints out : "-L/home/bino/local/lib -lbpm -lm"

It also comes with a default libbpm.pc which will be installed under
@prefix@/lib/pkgconfig, this is used under some build systems that use
"pkgconfig". This is the more general version of the above script, 
so 

[niblap] ~/ilc/devel/cvs/especSoft/libbpm $ pkg-config --libs libbpm

prints out : "-L/home/bino/local/lib -lbpm -lm"

This should make using this library in a build environment reasonably
monkey proof.

Currently the library installs .so and .a files for each sublibrary
and one for the main library as well, so a bit redundant, we can
change that later on.

Versioning is done in the beginning of configure.ac, so please keep
track there if you change the version of the library.
